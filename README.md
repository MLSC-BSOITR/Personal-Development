So glad you asked! Share and promote your favorite managing and leading resources/go-to's (books, articles, Twitter feeds, videos, etc.) by reviewing the [contributor guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md), then making a pull request (one per item/entry). For questions, go ahead and post an issue in the Issues Tracker. 

### How can I get more info on [missing topic]?
Please make a request via the Issues Tracker if there’s a topic you'd like this list to include.

### Did you write all this yourself? (Credit/Attribution)
Almost none of the content shared in this list is by the authors. Where there’s a link, the content below it is generally a summary of the linked webpage. When there’s no link, it’s either original content or gives credit/attribution. Some book summaries are from [Personal MBA](https://personalmba.com/), which Joe piloted and consulted on, but not to the extent where he is willing to take credit for its content.
